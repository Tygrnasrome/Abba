Build on Linux:
* Install GLEW and GLFW libraries.
* Run make.

Build on Windows (Visual Studio 2019):
* GLEW and GLFW libraries are installed in the /include and /lib directories so no need to download anything.
* Just build the VS solution.

Build on Windows (mingw32):
* GLEW and GLFW libraries are installed in the /include and /lib-mingw32 directories so no need to download anything.
* Run mingw32-make.
