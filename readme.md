## About
This OpenGL project introduced me to 3D graphics programming. It was my first project of this kind. I worked on it as part of a team with my friend (he doesn't have a GitHub account, so I couldn't add him as a contributor). The project was initiated and guided by our instructor, Tomáš. You can find the learning materials we used [here](https://kapsa.cz/cs/world-of-tanks-ii).
>*Multiplayer is implemented, but it's limited to local use on my domain.*
